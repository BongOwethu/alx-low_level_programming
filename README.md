# **Welcome to my C prigramming journey!** 🌟
## Sprint 1 🏄
- Here I am on sprint 1 in the ALX program. We are learning C Programming using Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Each topic and task is designed to help me better learn and write code tha willhelpme pass the checker.
- As each week passes by I willbe challenged to learn adapt, and solve coding problems. Which is exciting!!😁
  
Here are the 18+ topics which I will cover.

 
Tasks that will done using data sturctures and algorithms in the C Programming language in the ALX Software engineering program.
